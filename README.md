# EvilInMyHead
Demo project

A small techno-demo of the game with some implemented mechanics. The technology stack used is DOTween, Zenject, Xnode, UniRX, New Input System. Implemented mechanics:
1) Component character system. Characters are generated and empowered using a single json file with descriptions of their characteristics. There are no prefabs prepared in advance.
2) Pathfinder, which works with the job system
3) Key reassignment system
4) Gamepad support
5) Answer choice window in dialogs
6) Radial inventory
7) Force field and wind shaders
8) No Unity Animator at all
9) Location changes are done within a single scene

All scripts (except third party plugins), sprites and animations were made by me, so are free to use for any purpose.
